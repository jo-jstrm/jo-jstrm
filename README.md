<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Johannes</h1>
<h3 align="center">An aspiring Data Scientist!</h3>

## What I am Working on üí™

Currently preparing for job interviews. Further, I am porting the content of my master thesis from a closed source code base to make it open source. It was a cool project about *Data-efficient Representation Learning for Cell Organelle Segmentation in Electron Microscopy Images* and I want to share it.

## Data Science Experience üí°

You are probably here because you are thinking about hiring me. I am still a fresh graduate, but already have experience in some aspects of data science and deep learning:
- Data prep üîß
  - Large-scale data processing using Apache Flink/Spark/ROS. Naturally, also use monolithic, overpowered workstations combined with PyTorch dataloaders.
  - Data transformation, cleaning, and other preprocessing, mostly using pandas and numpy.
- Computer vision üëì
  - Handle 2d and 3d (Lidar) images and train deep learning models for classification, bounding box regression, semantic segmenation, and compression.
  - Self-supervised learning for pre-training of vision models.
  - Work with CNN, GAN, VAE, Transformer architectures.
- Natural language processing üóíÔ∏è
  - Use NLP models to retrieve text from databasees and to retrieve information from text.
  - Employ techniques such as lemming and stemming to improve training.
  - Work with BERT variants.
- Research üí°
  - Published work about decentral setup of nodes in a data streaming engine in VLIoT@VLDB 2021 ([paper](https://www.ronpub.com/ojiot/OJIOT_2021v7i1n06_Giouroukis.html)).
  - Published work about 2d/3d real-time video compression on ML4AD@NeurIPS 2021 ([paper]([https://github.com/daniel-bogdoll/deep_generative_models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03201))).
- Train regression models and solve problems on tabular data and time series.
- Train, deploy and maintain ML models in the cloud.

## Projects üíª
If you are *really* interested in my work, below are *all* projects I did while studying. In chronological order, so please don't be too judgy on my earlier code. We all had to start somewhere üòú. Will be cool memories in the future. PEP8 is my friend, I swear.
- Learn SQL and MapReduce ([click](https://github.com/jo-jstrm/SQL-and-MapReduce)).
- Implement an **Extended Kalman Filter** for pose estimation of a car in Apache Flink ([click](https://github.com/jo-jstrm/DBPro-EKF-SLAM)).
- Bachelor Thesis: Research and benchmark a decentral way of organizing nodes in a **data streaming engine** ([click](https://github.com/jo-jstrm/rime-data-streaming-iot)). Published at VLIoT@VLDB 2021 ([paper](https://www.ronpub.com/ojiot/OJIOT_2021v7i1n06_Giouroukis.html)).
- Find new **clusters** of Customers in a real-world dataset from Robert Bosch GmbH. Visualize Results and pitch them to management. Closed source.
- Predict the filling level of glass containers based on a real dataset from a German recycling company. Mostly **time series data**. Visualize Results and pitch them to management. Closed source.
- [Pandemic Package](https://github.com/jo-jstrm/Damaged-Package-Detection): automatically detect damaged packages in a warehouse based on video data in real-time. Lots of **CNNs and bounding boxes**.
- SciQuack: Answer free-text questions about scientific papers by highlighting specific passages in the papers. Uses database and knowledge graph. Lots of deep learning and **NLP**. Includes website as frontend. Closed source.
- Compress 2d and 3d videos from autonomous vehicles for remote assistance using deep learning ([click](https://github.com/daniel-bogdoll/deep_generative_models)). Using **GANs and VAEs** on camera and lidar video data for real-time processing. Published in ML4AD@NeurIPS 2021 ([paper]([https://github.com/daniel-bogdoll/deep_generative_models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03201))).
- Optimize energy usage and storage, predict energy production in smart grids ([click](https://github.com/jo-jstrm/Smart-Grid-Applications)). Mostly **time series data**.
- Learn Vulkan & GLSL basics, build **custom general-purpose shaders** ([click](https://github.com/jo-jstrm/Vulkan-GPU-Programming)). Out of my comfort zone (I was the only non-computer-graphics guy) and painful at times, but totally worth it.
- [SmartHomeBuddy](https://github.com/jo-jstrm/SmartHomeBuddy): identify smart home devices in your home network using machine learning. Including PoC of a complete app. Three-month **scholarship** by the German [Bundesnachrichtendienst](https://www.bnd.bund.de/DE/Karriere/SummerOfCode/SummerOfCode_node.html).
- Cofvefe Scale: Fun little arduino project where the goal was to design an information appliance while applying the **design thinking** process. My appliance turned out to be a coffee scale. Very innovation, much wow.
- Master Thesis: *Data-efficient Representation Learning for Cell Organelle Segmentation in Electron Microscopy Images*. Using **self-supervised learning** and **transformers**. Lots of optimization for low-powered hardware. Currently closed source for *reasons*, but working on open-sourcing.
